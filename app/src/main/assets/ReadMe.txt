
DESCRIPTION

This project ports the Windows application Emu48 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu48 source code remains untouch because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu48 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e48/e49) than the original Windows application!
